      Walchand College of Engineering is situated midway between Sangli and
      Miraj cities at Vishrambag, Sangli. The WCE campus is located on about 90
      acres of land on southern side of Sangli – Miraj road. In 1947, the
      college made a modest beginning as New Engineering College, with a single
      program leading to B.E. (Civil) degree. In the year 1955, the College was
      renamed as Walchand College of Engineering as part of the new arrangements
      and pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Development Program mainly funded
      by Seth Walchand Hirachand Memorial Trust and the Government. The
      Government appointed an Ad Hoc Committee for conducting the college from
      May 1955, later replaced by the Administrative Council in 1956. The Ad Hoc
      Committee added two more degree programs in B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E.
      (Electrical) in 1955 with the intake of 20 each. Three Diploma programs
      also started in 1955 – Civil (40 intake), Mechanical (20) and Electrical
      (20). Post Graduate programs in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical
      Engineering and Diploma program in Industrial Electronics were introduced
      in 1971. In 1986 the UG and PG programs in Electronics Engineering and UG
      program in Computer Science and Engineering were introduced. PG program in
      CSE was introduced in 1997. In 2001, added B.E. program in Information
      Technology with an intake of 60 students. An additional intake of 30
      students was also sanctioned for Computer Science & Engineering program,
      resulting in total intake of 390 students for all branches at UG level and
      106 at PG level. As part of strategic planning, PG section is being
      strengthened and PG intake has now steadily risen to 240 across 10
      programs. The College has a QIP scheme for full-time doctoral programs and
      also offers Ph. D. programs of Shivaji University in various branches of
      engineering.
